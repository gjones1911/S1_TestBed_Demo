# This directory is meant to host the code associated with the random forest model. 

# This includes code for creating, pickeling, etc.
    - this is not the same as the code that is used to call the predictive function of the model

### Due to the environmental constraints of pickeling python objects, it is important to note that the model was retrained on historical data and saved locally. -- !! If this is not the case (i.e., cloned repository, etc.), It is important that the model be recreated (i.e., created, trained, pickeled, etc.) before running.
