# This directory contains the code used to call the random forest model to predict on data from the S1 testbed using MQTT and sending predictions via MQTT.

# The code is currently working as expected but can be cleaned up, optimized, etc.
# The following are some needed To-Do's
    - Clean up code to not include:
        - Topics for UE5 motors
        - Predictions for UE5 motors
    - Potentially change over to Mosquitto
