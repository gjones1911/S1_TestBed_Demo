2025-01-27 16:55:00.535827: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:210] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
All PyTorch model weights were used when initializing TFGPT2LMHeadModel.

All the weights of TFGPT2LMHeadModel were initialized from the PyTorch model.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFGPT2LMHeadModel for predictions without further training.
