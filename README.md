# S1_TestBed_Demo
This repo is for the S1-testbed demo for the Applied Systems Lab (ASL) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The project is used to support the operation of a S1-testbed Digital Twin demo. The project allows for the two way control of the physical and digital versions of the motor in both digital-->physical and physical--> digital operations.
